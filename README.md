# Welcome to PanNDE!

PanNDE is an attempt at building a modular, developable infrastructure for doing field simulations (initially elastodynamic) for Non-Destructive Evaluation applications. Performance as well as low-level access is a key concern to enable rapid, adaptive modelling for model inversion or for MAPOD like applications. As with all research, work begets work, and development will hopefully continue. For now, if you find use for this, great, and if not, hopefully future development will bring features that are useful, or that the code base provides a jumping-off point for other development by other researchers. For now, good luck, and have fun! Science is a grand adventure!

# Building PanNDE

1. Download latest release
2. Ensure correct dependencies are installed, and are in the search path
  - MPI
  - VTK >= 9.0 (built and linked with the same MPI being used for PanNDE)
  - Metis
  - gcc >= 7.3
  - cmake >= 3.13.5
3. Ensure Python3 is installed for some included post processing utilities
  - this is optional, if the utilities are not desired
4. cd to `PanNDE/root/directory`
5. generate compilation instructions using `cmake -B build -S .`
6. compile with `make -C build`

# Running the Test Suites

1. Ensure PanNDE is built on the system
2. Run serial tests:
  - `./bin/HostDataTests > HostDataTestResults.log`
3. Run parallel tests:
  - `mpirun -n 4 -outfile-pattern=NetMPITestResult_%r.log ./bin/NetMPITests`
  - `mpirun -n 4 -outfile-pattern=VTKIOTestResult_%r.log ./bin/VTKIOTests`
  - `mpirun -n 4 -outfile-pattern=HostSolverTestResult_%r.log ./bin/HostSolverTests`


# Creating a Demonstration Case

1. Ensure PanNDE is built on the system
2. There are three demonstration case builders provided:
  - Aluminum angle stock with single transducer:
    1. Run `./bin/DemoCaseBuilder`
    2. The resulting case file will be `./data/demo_case_0.vtu`
  - Quasi-isotropic 8-ply IM7 CFRP layup with single transducer:
    1. Run `./bin/PlateCaseBuilder -o $JOB_FILENAME_NO_EXTENSION`
    2. The resulting case file will be named with the filename provided
  - Parametric plate with two transducers:
    1. Run `./bin/ParameterizedDemoPlateCase -p $PARAMETER_FILE_YAML`
    2. The resulting case file will be generated based on the parameters contained in the provided parameter file
    3. A sample parameter file that produces the previous quasi-isotropic 8-ply CFRP case is provided in `demo_quasi_iso_cfrp.yaml`. The case can be changed to suit user's use cases, however stability criteria are the user's responsibility

# Running a Case

1. Ensure PanNDE is built on the system
2. Produce a `*.vtu` file that provides all required input data
  - For required data, see Job File Requirements, below
3. Run `mpirun -n $NPROCS ./bin/DemoModelNxd -f $JOB_FILE -o $RESULT_FILE_NAME_ROOT`
  - results will be written to a `*.pvtu`/`*.vtu` set with appropriate file numbering schema for reconstruction in scientific visualization software

# Job File Requirements

1. Elastodynamic parameter fields:
  - cell centered stiffness coefficients named:
    - `C11 C12 C13 C14 C15 C16 C22 C23 C24 C25 C26 C33 C34 C35 C36 C44 C45 C46 C55 C56 C66`
  - cell centered density values named: 
    - `density`
2. Time step and file write frequency information:
  - simulation time step named:
    - `dt`
  - simulation write times array named:
    - `write_times`
3. Hanning windowed Ncycle sine transducer excitation information:
  - Number of transducers named:
    - `NTransducers`
  - Transducer parameters:
    - `XD<transducer index>/XCenter`
    - `XD<transducer index>/YCenter`
    - `XD<transducer index>/ZCenter`
    - `XD<transducer index>/Frequency`
    - `XD<transducer index>/NCycle`
    - `XD<transducer index>/Phase`
    - `XD<transducer index>/Radius`

# Future Work/Features

1. Generic transducers, or more transducer type options
2. PZT model
3. Thermal conduction model
4. GPU data allocator and solver
